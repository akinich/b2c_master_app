# ðŸš€ Deployment Checklist

Follow this checklist step-by-step to deploy your Multi-App Dashboard.

## âœ… Phase 1: Supabase Setup (COMPLETED)

- [x] Created Supabase project
- [x] Ran initial schema SQL

- [ ] Set to Private (recommended) or Public

### Step 2: Add Files to GitHub

Create these files in order (I've provided all the code):

**Root Files:**
- [ ] `.gitignore`
- [ ] `requirements.txt`
- [ ] `README.md`
- [ ] `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` (this file)
- [ ] `app.py`

**config/ folder:**
- [ ] `config/__init__.py`
- [ ] `config/database.py`

**auth/ folder:**
- [ ] `auth/__init__.py`
- [ ] `auth/session.py`
- [ ] `auth/login.py`

**components/ folder:**
- [ ] `components/__init__.py`
- [ ] `components/sidebar.py`
- [ ] `components/dashboard.py`
- [ ] `components/admin_panel.py`

**utils/ folder:**
- [ ] `utils/__init__.py`

**modules/ folder:**
- [ ] `modules/__init__.py`
- [ ] `modules/module_template.py`

### Step 3: Add Your Mini Apps
- [ ] Create `modules/order_extractor.py`
- [ ] Create `modules/shipping_label_generator.py`
- [ ] Create `modules/mrp_label_generator.py`
- [ ] Create `modules/woocommerce_zoho_export.py`
- [ ] Create `modules/stock_price_updater.py`

> **Note:** Share your existing module code with me, and I'll help you adapt them to work with this framework!

## âœ… Phase 3: Streamlit Cloud Deployment

### Step 1: Deploy App
- [ ] Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
- [ ] Sign in with GitHub
- [ ] Click "New app"
- [ ] Select your repository
- [ ] Branch: `main` (or your default branch)
- [ ] Main file path: `app.py`
- [ ] Click "Advanced settings"

### Step 2: Add Secrets
Copy and paste this into the Secrets section (replace with your actual values):

```toml
[supabase]
url = "https://your-project-id.supabase.co"
service_role_key = "your-service-role-key-here"
anon_key = "your-anon-key-here"

[api]
website_api_key = "your-website-api-key"
# Add other API keys as needed
```

- [ ] Added Supabase URL
- [ ] Added service_role_key
- [ ] Added anon_key
- [ ] Added website API key
- [ ] Added any other API keys your modules need

### Step 3: Deploy
- [ ] Click "Deploy"
- [ ] Wait for deployment (usually 2-5 minutes)
- [ ] Check for any errors in logs

## âœ… Phase 4: Create First Admin User

### Option A: Through Supabase Dashboard
1. [ ] Go to Supabase â†’ Authentication â†’ Users
2. [ ] Click "Add user"
3. [ ] Email: `your-admin-email@company.com`
4. [ ] Password: `create-secure-password`
5. [ ] Auto Confirm User: **YES**
6. [ ] Copy the user's UUID from the list
7. [ ] Go to SQL Editor and run:

```sql
INSERT INTO user_profiles (id, full_name, role_id, is_active)
VALUES (
    'PASTE-USER-UUID-HERE',
    'Your Name',
    (SELECT id FROM roles WHERE role_name = 'Admin'),
    TRUE
);
```

### Option B: Through SQL (All-in-one)
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create admin user (replace email and password)
-- Note: This requires service_role privileges
SELECT auth.create_user(
    jsonb_build_object(
        'email', 'admin@yourcompany.com',
        'password', 'YourSecurePassword123!',
        'email_confirm', true
    )
);

-- Get the user ID (will show in results above)
-- Then insert profile:
INSERT INTO user_profiles (id, full_name, role_id, is_active)
VALUES (
    'USER-ID-FROM-ABOVE',
    'Admin Name',
    (SELECT id FROM roles WHERE role_name = 'Admin'),
    TRUE
);
```

- [ ] Created first admin user
- [ ] Verified admin can login

## ðŸŽ‰ Deployment Complete!

Once all checkboxes are checked, your Multi-App Dashboard is live and ready to use!

## ðŸ“ž Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Streamlit Cloud Logs:**
   - Go to your app on Streamlit Cloud
   - Click "Manage app" â†’ "Logs"

2. **Check Supabase Logs:**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard
   - Click "Logs" in sidebar

3. **Common Issues:**
   - **Module not found:** Check file exists and `show()` function is defined
   - **Database errors:** Verify secrets are correct
   - **Login fails:** Check user exists in both auth.users and user_profiles
   - **Access denied:** Check role_permissions table

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

After successful deployment:
1. Share your existing module code with me
2. I'll help adapt each module to work with the framework
3. We'll test them one by one
4. Deploy updates to Streamlit Cloud
